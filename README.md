# climate-sim

Climate simulation research completed at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory during Summer 2024.

Includes elements of:
- Physics Simulation
- Numerical Methods
- Optimization
- Pedagogy
- Machine Learning

This project was expanded during Fall 2024-Spring 2025 to include a Master's Thesis at MIT, related to studying the adjoint of Pytorch-based climate emulation models, such as Samudra.
